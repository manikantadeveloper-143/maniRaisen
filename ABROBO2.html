//////////////  when there is parent-child realtionship in react,in that case how event.stop propagation works short answer ////////////////
In a parent-child relationship in React, event.stopPropagation() can be used to prevent an event from bubbling up the DOM tree from the child component to its parent component. 
This means that when an event occurs on a child element, invoking event.stopPropagation() prevents that event from triggering any event listeners on the parent elements,
 effectively stopping its propagation upwards in the DOM tree
